## Description
In this repository you will find files for a prototype employee tracker. This application allows users to input employee and workplace information via Node.JS and store this data to a MySQL database. Users can view existing deapartments, positions, and employees within their organization, and add each to their respective categories as well. Ideally this command-line program will allows users to oversee and manage various departments and individuals quickly and efficiently.

## Installation
The application may be forked from this repository. Once inside the folder on your local computer, run an NPM install via the command line. This will install the existing 'inquirer', 'mysql2', 'console.table', and 'dotenv' packages required to run this application. Create an .env file to store your credentials to your MySQL database before running this application. The application will run after entering 'node iserver.js' in the command line; this repository also includes .sql files that can be used to pre-populate your MySQL database.
## Usage
A demonstration video of this application can be found here: [https://watch.screencastify.com/v/RdMMSHJO1EJ2HZ70D9i1](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/RdMMSHJO1EJ2HZ70D9i1).

Features to be added in the future would include functionality for deleting any department, role, or employee info from the database, updating any or all information within those categories, and also specifying whether an employee has a manager in the command line (a Y/N prompt) instead of having that pre-populated via seeds.sql.

## Testing
This application was tested locally via the command line and MySQL Workbench.
